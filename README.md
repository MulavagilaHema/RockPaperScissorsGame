# RockPaperScissorsGame
In this project I have used, python basics like
Variables, 
Functions,
Dictionary,
Random Library,
List,
If statement,
fstring concept,
Else and elif statements- Refactoring, Nested if.
The game is between user and computer, user is player.
player can select rock, paper, scissors, 
and computer selects one randomly using random library.
Game rules are
implemented using if and nested if.
The program displays the output based on the rules and options selected, if player and computer chooses the same it's a tie.
